# classic Wow World Buff Client

World buff client uploads current timers from lua data file generated by [Nova World Buffs Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-world-buffs). 
This data file is updated every time user logs out of game, switch characters or reloads the game. (/reload)
The client will upload timers for all known realms and factions. Data are being send only when client detects that file has been changed

## Installation

Make sure you have [Nova World Buffs Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nova-world-buffs) installed. 
In order to run the client you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Any version will do. Requires only 50MB. 
Node.js allows you to run programs in JavaScript to run your computer. It is the same language like in your web browser. 
Open cmd.exe and type "node -v" and you should see installed version. If not try to to restart your computer.

[Download the files from this repository in ZIP archive](https://github.com/techi602/wb-client/archive/master.zip)
Uncompress the files - currently in your SavedVariables folder
c:\Games\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}\SavedVariables\
The folder should already contain file NovaWorldBuffs.lua

Run the script in cmd.exe and type "node wb.js". The application will run in console until you close the console and show you current status.

## Issues

I will simplify the installation so the script will try to detect the folder automatically and create CMD launch file.
